This project is forked from Andy Graulund's TweetNest project in order to remove "Archives not found." bug. I also made some changes to the links in header in order to provide better user experience. If you are on a shared hosting and want to keep your existing .htaccess file, this version is for you.

==================================
1. Fix Favorites section
2. Make "Recent Tweets" a consistent element in the sidebar
3. What else?
